## ✨ Features

- 📊 Generate comprehensive visualizations with minimal code.
- 📈 Perform automated EDA on your datasets.
- 📉 Identify patterns and trends in your data.
- 📑 Create detailed visualiation reports for easy sharing.

## 🔧 Prerequisites

- Python 3.11.0
- AutoViz library
- Web browser for viewing HTML reports

## 📥 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PreProd-Internship/DIY-Python-AutoViz
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended). If using Conda:
```bash
conda create -n env_name python==3.11.0 -y
conda activate env_name
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Start the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run source/app.py
```

2. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:8501`

3. Provide your CSV file path, configure the parameters, and generate visualizations and EDA reports!

## 🗃️ Data Description

### urban_public_transporation.csv

A mock dataset generated using [Mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com/) for learning purposes. The `urban_public_transporation.csv` dataset focuses on analyzing the performance of a city's public transportation system, identifying patterns in ridership, and optimizing routes and schedules to improve efficiency and user satisfaction. Each row represents a single bus trip with columns like

- `trip_id`,
- `time_of_day`,
- `bus_id`,
- `weather`,
- `delay_minutes`, and so on.

> *Note: `delay_minutes` is the dependent variable (`dep_var`) in this dataset. If you'd like, other fields like `number_of_passengers` or `fuel_consumption` could also be explored as alternative target variables for different perspectives.*

### Use Cases in AutoViz:
- 🚍 Visualizing trip performance based on time of day and traffic conditions.
- ⛽ Analyzing fuel efficiency in relation to traffic and weather.
- 🚌 Identifying underperforming routes based on passenger count and delays.
- 🚦 Comparing bus and driver performance to optimize staffing and assignments.
- ⏱️ Analyzing the correlation between delays and trip duration under different conditions.

This dataset and business case provide a rich, real-world scenario that highlights the capabilities of AutoViz.
