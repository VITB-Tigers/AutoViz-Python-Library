```
1. Explain the purpose of the AutoViz library in data visualization.

2. How does AutoViz simplify exploratory data analysis (EDA)? Provide an overview.

3. What are the key features of AutoViz? List and describe them in detail.

4. Compare AutoViz with other EDA libraries like SweetViz or Pandas Profiling. What are the unique advantages of AutoViz?

5. Explain the role of the AutoViz_Class in the AutoViz library. Why is it central to the library's functionality?

6. What are the required input formats for AutoViz? Describe how it handles different file types like CSV or Excel.

7. What is the impact of specifying the chart_format parameter in AutoViz? Explain its significance.

8. Describe the steps involved in loading a dataset and generating visualizations with AutoViz. Provide example code.

9. How does AutoViz handle missing values or null data during visualization?

10. Can AutoViz be used with large datasets? If so, explain how it manages computational efficiency and memory usage.

11. Write a step-by-step guide to install AutoViz and generate EDA visualizations for a sample dataset in Python. Include code examples.

12. What types of visualizations does AutoViz generate? Provide examples of charts it creates, such as scatter plots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps.

13. Explain the role of the max_rows_analyzed parameter in AutoViz. Why might this be useful for large datasets?

14. What customization options does AutoViz offer? Describe how to tailor its visualizations to suit specific needs.

15. Design a pipeline that integrates AutoViz with data preprocessing steps, such as cleaning and transformation. Provide sample code.

16. What are the limitations of AutoViz? Describe scenarios where it might not be the best choice.

17. How does AutoViz handle target variables for supervised learning? Provide an example of visualizations AutoViz creates for a target variable.

18. Can AutoViz generate insights from time-series data? Explain its capabilities and provide a relevant example.

19. Write Python code to visualize a dataset using AutoViz and explain each step of the process.

20. How would you extend AutoVizâ€™s functionality to include additional custom plots not supported by default?
